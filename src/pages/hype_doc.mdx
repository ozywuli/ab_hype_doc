## Updated the Assessment Overview page to use the latest View pattern

The assessment overview page was using custom a pre Luna View layout that was inaccessible and looked bad. Nobody bothered to update for a 1+ year, so I took the initiative to update the assessment overview page. Now, not only did I improve the accessibility of the overview page, but I gave the UI a refresh and allow it to be opened within a quick view.
